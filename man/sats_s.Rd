SATS Student Data
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of the dataset. ~~
 Student data for the Survey of Attitudes Toward Statistics (SATS-36; Schau, 2003). Reverse coding for appropriate items has already been completed. Respondents who did not consent to participation have already been removed. Additionally, birthdates were originally recorded for matching purposes: these have been removed. Prior to removal, however, age at the time of survey completion was computed and any response with a computed age less than 18 was removed. This data.frame is wide formatted - see \link{sats_sci_long} for the corresponding long-formatted data.frame.

\usage{data("sats_s")}
\format{
 A data frame with 3730 observations on the following 123 variables.
  \describe{
\item{\code{StudentID}}{Unique value for each student.}
\item{\code{CourseID}}{Unique value for each course.}
\item{\code{InstructorID}}{Unique value for each instructor.}
\item{\code{Semester}}{Semester in which data were collected.}
\item{\code{Pre.StartTime}}{Date and time student began Pre survey.}
\item{\code{Pre.EndTime}}{Date and time student completed Pre survey.}
\item{\code{Pre.Consent}}{Student response to informed consent question at the Pre-course survey. Note that 1 denotes that the student gave consent to participate while a 0 indicates there was no pre-survey response at all (i.e., a 0 does NOT mean that the student did not consent). A response of 2 indicated a response of no consent. All students who responsed with a "2" in the Post-course survey (Post.Consent = 2) were removed, while students who did not consent in the Pre-course survey (Pre.Consent = 2) were removed UNLESS they consented to the Post-course survey. In this scenario (Pre.Consent = 2, Post.Consent = 1), only Post-course survey results are retained and all Pre-course survey results are removed; there are four observations that are in this scenario.}
