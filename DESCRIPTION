Description: Data collected from statistics students and their instructors as 
    part of the SATS Data Warehouse project. Data were collected from 2007 to 
    2010. Students answered the pre- and post- SATS, instructors supplied 
    student grades and answered an annual survey about themselves. For each 
    course section, the instructor answered a course survey describing their 
    enacted classroom behaviors as well as course / section characteristics.
