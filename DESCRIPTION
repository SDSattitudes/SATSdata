Description: Data collected from statistics students and their instructors as 
    part of the SATS Data Warehouse project. Data were collected from 2007 to 
    2010. Students answered the pre- and post- SATS-36 (Schau, 2003) 
    <https://www.evaluationandstatistics.com/>, instructors supplied student 
    grades and answered an annual survey about themselves. For each course 
    section, the instructor answered a course survey describing their enacted 
    classroom behaviors as well as course / section characteristics.
